This is the source code for a mini keyboard, similar to one on a mobile phone which was my second Visual Basic Assignment. 

Functionality required for this assignment included: 

1. Provide two modes, "Multi-Press" and "Prediction", like that of a mobile phone. 
2. On pressing any character key a number of times, the corresponding letter would appear. 
3. On pressing any character key a number of times, it would enable a timer like that of a mobile phone. 
4. On selecting the 000 button, the text in the WordBuilder textbox would be appended to the textbox. 
5. On selecting the Enter button, the cursor in the textbox would move to the next line.
6. Provide a hierarchical menu including open and save features.
